                              <br>
                              <p>Mary was born thanks to a bet her dad made with her mum, that dockers would win the derby against eagles over 18 years ago, but ironically supports the eagles, typical aries. She pulled a Benjamin Button, as she’s the youngest of 3 but is an old soul and the most mature. Marys sarcastic 24/7 365. She’s the girl that everyone looks like, even if you don’t, you do. Brown hair and brown eyes and you’re her doppelganger.</p>
                              <br>
                              <p>After quitting cheerleading to get a Mcflurry and mixed basketball because she realized she was too short to slam dunk, Mary’s achievements are limited to one trophy. “Capsize Queen”, from her sailing days, which she also gave up because it was “too windy”. She’s most proud of the 2879 Nandos points she’s managed to rack up, and since 1 point = $1, you can decide whether that’s impressive or not. Her talents include smelling a crisp bowl and being able to tell you what flavour it is and pretending to know everything about all sports to impress boys.</p>
                              <br>
                              <p>Mary’s love of music stretches from Louis Armstrong’s “La Vie En Rose”, all the way to Cardi B’s “Bodak Yellow”, and everything in between. With her passion for music she thought why not pursue a career in it, and after being traumatised from singing I Am Beautiful by Christiana Aguilera in front of her whole school, she knew being the next Beyonce wasn’t an option, so doing a Diploma of Radio and Media Broadcasting at North Metropolitan Tafe was the next best thing.</p>
                              <br>
                              <p>Mary is constantly waiting for the One Direction hiatus to be over, but in the meantime she’s on Boom Radio!</p>
                              <br>

                      <p>Lauren born and bred in Perth, this confident, loud, woman who doesn’t know how to be quiet in serious situations is a passionate radio presenter. Sport isn’t so much her thing with the only thing she can keep in shape are her eyebrows. When it comes to running, the closest to that she has gotten to is the running man challenge, this challenge video of Lauren was actually posted online and copped a whopping 4 million views, something she claims yet regrets every day. She creates many videos online with over 35,000 followers on Instagram posting somewhat funny content, no one can really explain what it is but some how her dancing in her room is actually funny to teenage girls.</p>

                            <h2>Sam</h2>
                            <p class="lead">Who is Sam?</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Sam is a 22 year old from Geraldton WA, who has been in the city for four years studying and working. He now lives in Nedlands with his four male housemates and tries to live the Golden Triangle lifestyle on a uni student budget.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>He is studying a diploma in radio and broadcasting because as his friends say, he has a face for radio and could talk for a living. Being the oldest of five siblings, he had to fight hard to get a word in, which is why he is never short of things to say. His love for radio started when he was little and used to commentate family kick to kick in the backyard, and his dream is to one day call the AFL or NBA for a living. Sam is ALWAYS talking sports (when he isn’t playing it), and has so many NBA and AFL stats in his brain that he forgets everything else in his day to day life like when he lost his car keys for six weeks and they were in the ignition the whole time. His Spotify playlists range from Kanye and Kendrick (who he’s seen in concert), to Morgan Saint and Last Dinosaurs, to Robbie Williams and Pink (which you can accredit to his mum and the 5 hour car trips to Perth when he was young).</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>You’ll always see Sam coming due to his repertoire of colourful and TV-themed T-Shirts, and you’ll hear him coming with his obscure Simpsons references and bad dad jokes. Sam has the attention span of a small puppy and can’t go a whole movie without adding his own commentary, but will eat ANYTHING insight so dinner dates are a safe bet.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Tune in and listen to his with his inviting voice and most of all his laughter</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>You can hear Sam on BOOM Radio with The Warm Up sports program from 7pm on Thursday</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>with his co-host Mez on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons</p>
